## What Is This Thing?

DirectGTD is a **keyboard-first, hierarchical task manager**. Think outliners meet GTD. No mouse required. All shortcuts. Zero fluff.

## The 60-Second Quick Start

1. Launch the app
2. Hit **Return** to create your first task
3. Type something
4. Hit **Return** again
5. Congratulations, you're a power user now

## The Only 7 Shortcuts You Need

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **Return** | Create new task below current one |
| **Space** | Edit the selected task |
| **Delete** | Delete selected task (no confirmation, we trust you) |
| **↑ ↓** | Navigate up/down |
| **Tab** | Indent (make it a subtask) |
| **Shift+Tab** | Outdent (promote it back up) |
| **Esc** | Cancel editing |

That's it. You now know 100% of DirectGTD.

## How Hierarchy Works

Tasks can have subtasks. Subtasks can have sub-subtasks. It's turtles all the way down.

**To make something a subtask:**
1. Select the task
2. Hit **Tab**

**To promote it back:**
1. Hit **Shift+Tab**

Parent tasks automatically get a disclosure triangle. Click it or just use arrow keys.

---

## Editing Tasks

Two ways:
1. **Space** - Edit selected task
2. **Click** - Select, then Space

When editing:
- **Return** saves
- **Esc** cancels
- Empty tasks get auto-deleted when you cancel (we're tidy like that)

## Navigation Like a Boss

- **↑↓** moves selection
- Works across all levels (expanded subtasks included)
- Auto-scrolls to keep selection visible
- Blue border means the view is focused (it should always be)

## Pro Tips

**Creating Tasks:**
- New tasks appear right below the selected one
- They inherit the same hierarchy level
- Start typing immediately (auto-enters edit mode)

**Organizing:**
- Tab/Shift+Tab works on any selected task
- Parent items auto-expand when you indent under them
- Delete removes the whole subtree (fair warning)

**Focus:**
- Click anywhere in the list area if shortcuts stop working
- The blue border means you're in business

## The Philosophy

DirectGTD follows one principle: **Get out of your way.**

No tags. No colors. No due dates. No drag-and-drop. No right-click menus.

Just hierarchical lists and your keyboard. If you need more features, you probably need a different app.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the mouse?**
A: Yes, but why would you?

**Q: Where's my data stored?**
A: Local SQLite database. Your stuff stays your stuff.

**Q: What if I delete something by accident?**
A: You learn to be careful. (Future versions might add undo.)

**Q: Can I collapse/expand items?**
A: Click the triangle on parent items. We know, you have to use the mouse for this one. Sorry.

**Q: Why can't I [insert feature]?**
A: Because scope creep kills productivity apps. This does one thing well.

## Troubleshooting

**Keyboard shortcuts not working?**
- Click anywhere in the task list
- Look for the blue border (that means focus)

**Task disappeared when I hit Esc?**
- Empty tasks auto-delete on cancel
- It's a feature, not a bug

**Can't Tab/Shift+Tab?**
- You can't outdent root-level items (nowhere to go)
- You can't indent the first item (nothing above it)
