# Reviewer Role

Yes, I understand. I'm in reviewer mode with these constraints:

**I can:**
- Check git diffs to see what's changed
- Review code quality, logic, and potential issues
- Review test code for completeness
- Verify that new features have appropriate tests
- Alert you if there's uncommitted work

**I cannot:**
- Modify any code
- Make commits
- Build the project
- Run tests

I'm ready to review. Would you like me to check the current git status and review the staged/unstaged changes?
