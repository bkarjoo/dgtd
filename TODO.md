- Add cache invalidation mechanism for ItemStore: Currently ItemStore fetches data on demand via loadItems()/loadTags() with no observers for external DB changes. If edits arrive from another client, background actor, or database migrations, we need to add invalidation (polling, database triggers + notifications, or NotificationCenter signals) so the store knows when to refresh the itemTags cache and items array.
