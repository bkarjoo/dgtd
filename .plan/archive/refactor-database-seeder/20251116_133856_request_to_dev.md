## Assignment

Address the critical and major issues identified in the code review (see `.lifecycle/refactor-database-seeder/20251116_132750_response_from_review.md` for full details).

**Review Status:** Needs Changes

The review team found that while the core requirement is met (extracting hardcoded data to JSON config), there are critical error handling and validation issues that must be addressed.

**Critical Issues to Fix (High Priority):**

1. **Silent data loss for invalid folder references** (lines 130-133, 213-216)
   - Projects and items referencing non-existent folders are skipped with only console warnings
   - Should fail fast with clear error instead of silent data loss

2. **Silent failures for invalid tag references** (lines 121-124, 147-151, 243-247)
   - Tags that don't exist in tagMap are silently skipped
   - Should fail fast or provide clear warnings

3. **Generic error handling** (lines 202-210)
   - NSError doesn't clearly indicate what went wrong
   - Consider custom error enum (SeedDataError) as suggested in review

**Major Issues to Fix (Medium Priority):**

4. **No duplicate folder/tag name handling** (lines 92-101, 104-109)
   - Duplicates silently overwrite earlier entries
   - Add detection and either throw error or warn clearly

5. **No validation of data values:**
   - Status values not validated against domain model
   - Color format not validated (should be #RRGGBB)
   - Numeric values (timeEstimate, dueInDays) not range-checked

**Suggested Approach from Review:**

- Create custom error enum (SeedDataError) with cases for specific failures
- Add validation layer for status, colors, numeric ranges
- Fail fast instead of continuing with silent failures
- Use proper error propagation instead of print() statements

**Build/Test Requirements:**

- Ensure build succeeds with no errors or warnings
- All existing unit tests (14 tests) must continue to pass
- Consider adding unit tests for edge cases (malformed JSON, invalid references, duplicates)

**When completing this work, include a reminder in your response.md for the recipient to read their README.md as crucial process requirements are documented there.**
